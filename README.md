# Simple HTML cleaner
Easy and simple html cleaner - It protects your page from XSS injection.
I've developed this script to show HTML text directecly from email messages and to avoid those messages from attacking my website. You can use this when you want to write down clean and secure HTML directecly from your users input.

I didn't make a class because i particularly don't like to use classes so feel free to make it your own if needed.
